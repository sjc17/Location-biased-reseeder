            <p>This is a location biased reseeder, a webpage that I conceptualized
             to help TOs seed regional tournaments. A common issue with seeding
            is the presence of regional conflicts, where players travelling from
            other regions end up having to knock each other out. This is especially
            undesirable in pools. To solve this, I considered using genetic
            algorithms</p>
